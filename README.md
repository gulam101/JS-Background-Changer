### Description:
This project justs utilised vanilla JS and focus on allowing the user to change the background of a colour by clicking the button in the middle of the screen. I wanted to see how JavaScript handles elements in HTML and CSS so that I could get used to working with them. The button has a simple css animation allowing it to change the background using an array with different HEX colours.

### Constrants:
None.
